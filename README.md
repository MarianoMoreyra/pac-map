<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Pac-Map Screen Shot](http://devenit.com/mini-games/pacmap/images/pacmap-tc.png)](http://devenit.com/mini-games/pacmap/)

After going through [Ania Kubow's](https://twitter.com/ania_kubow) tutorial at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) on how to develop a Pac-Man in JavaScript, I felt the need to create this tool so everyone can create their own maps when following along Ania's great tutorial!

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on learning how to code the Pac-Man in JavaScript and not in creating the array for the map
* Hopefuly, it might motivate you to go a step forward and create a multi-level Pac-Man
* I wanted to practice a little bit of Vue JS so I picked this project to do it :)


### Built With
This project was built with the following tools.
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Highlight JS](https://highlightjs.org/)


### Installation
This project doesn't require to be installed as I chose to use Vue linking it direclty from the CDN.
